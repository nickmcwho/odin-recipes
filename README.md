HTML Project 1: Recipes

This project will put my very basic HTML skillz to the test. I'll be tasked with setting up a website containing a few delicious recipes. More specifically, I'll be displaying my ability to write HTML boilerplate, create relative links, write ordered and unordered lists, and embed images. 

Wish me luck.
